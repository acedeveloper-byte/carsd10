<h3 class="h5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Service Cancellation</span></h3>
</li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you cancel the service before a towing vehicle has been dispatched, you will not be charged any cancellation fee.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a towing vehicle has already been dispatched at the time of cancellation, a cancellation fee may apply. This fee helps cover incurred costs such as fuel, travel time, and manpower.</span></li>
</ul>
